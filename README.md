# The Odin Project - Landing Page (Project 2)

This project is the second hands-on assignment in the **Foundations curriculum of The Odin Project**, where the goal is to apply foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to build a complete, styled landing page.

## Project Theme: Dream Trip to Switzerland

While the original instructions provided a structural reference, I chose to **personalize the project around the theme of “Dream Trip to Switzerland.”** Using the structure and layout taught in the course, I built upon the foundational template and crafted a fully themed page that reflects the beauty and experience of planning a dream vacation to Switzerland.

## Personalization & Design

The landing page includes:

- A **hero section** with a custom image and tagline introducing the Swiss travel theme
- A **feature section** with four distinct cards highlighting unique travel experiences
- A soothing, travel-inspired color palette and elegant typography
- Real, royalty-free imagery sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to visually support the content

All content was written or adapted to align with the theme, giving the site a personal and immersive feel beyond the technical requirements.

## What I Learned

- **HTML/CSS Structure:** Practiced writing semantic, organized HTML and applying clean CSS styles for layout and spacing
- **Flexbox:** Learned to align and distribute content efficiently using `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`
- **Responsive Layout Thinking:** Built layout sections that maintain structure and readability across screen sizes
- **Custom Fonts & Visual Hierarchy:** Used Google Fonts to establish a clear tone and improve aesthetics

## Skills Demonstrated

- Flexbox layout
- Semantic HTML and accessibility considerations
- CSS styling and spacing
- Image handling and optimization
- Theming and content personalization
- File structure organization

## Image Sources

## Future Improvements

- Add a responsive design for mobile devices(coming up in 3rd section of the Foundations Course)
- Include a testimonial or quote section
- Implement a call-to-action (CTA) and footer section for completeness
